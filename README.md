## Nodejs AIO boilerplate 2.0

This repo is intended to be an alternative to my original [Node js AIO boilerplate repo](https://github.com/SamuelPires1999/NodeJS-AIO-boilerplate).

I'll be using some more "bleeding-edge" techs here such as

-   Vitest for testing
-   Tsup for TS compiling

And others in the future, very experimental things.

Fell free to use it as a kickstarter for your typescript Nodejs projects.
